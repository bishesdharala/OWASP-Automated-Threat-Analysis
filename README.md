SCREEENSHOT :-
https://anonfiles.com/XeV3hfE3od/owasp_PNG

Automated Attack Vectors on Commercial Sites begin to grow each day with high metrics.
This project is a re-modelling of one of those attacks.
I used Burpsuite to capture the response but you'r better off using the browser's integrated Inspect Mode !


Variables Listing :-
$cc = card
$mes = month
$ano = year
$cvv = cvv
$token = Site's relative CSRF/other tokens

Usage :-
Extract the master files on C://xampp/htdocs/{foldername}
Run Apache on Xampp
Localhost/{foldername}

Note:-
This is just a raw api i made.All captures have been removed..
Any modification and further usage is a matter of individual Liability !

GoodDay ;]
